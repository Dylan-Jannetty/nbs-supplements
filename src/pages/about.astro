                <p>
                  After years of working in pharmacy and seeing what goes into most supplements, 
                  we were honestly disgusted. <span class="text-nbs-accent font-semibold">Proprietary blends</span> that hide 
                  underdosed ingredients. <span class="text-nbs-accent font-semibold">Artificial fillers</span> that serve no purpose 
                  except to bulk up capsules. <span class="text-nbs-accent font-semibold">Marketing claims</span> with zero scientific backing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We knew there had to be a better way. As pharmacists, we understand bioavailability, 
                  drug interactions, and what actually works at the cellular level. We decided to use 
                  that knowledge to create supplements we'd actually give to our own families.

                <p>
                  We believe your body knows the difference between natural and synthetic ingredients. 
                  That's why we source <span class="text-nbs-secondary font-semibold">natural compounds</span> whenever possible – 
                  from guarana extract instead of synthetic caffeine to monk fruit instead of artificial sweeteners.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But "natural" doesn't mean "weak." Every natural ingredient we choose is backed by clinical research 
                  and dosed at levels that actually work. We're not interested in fairy dusting or feel-good marketing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="text-nbs-primary font-semibold">Transparency is non-negotiable.</span> We list every ingredient 
                  and its exact dose on our labels. No proprietary blends, no hidden fillers, no surprises. 
                  If you can't pronounce it or don't know why it's there, we probably won't use it.
